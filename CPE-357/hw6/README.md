Steps to build and run httpd:
1. Download all the required files
2. Run the Makefile by typing in "make"
3. Run httpd by typing "./httpd <port>" - use any port from 1024 - 65536

Notes:
-Running the "cgi-like" commands will run in the "cgi-like" folder and not in the same directory as httpd
-Extra "/" characters will be ignored, preventing commands from being run in the root directory
-Using telnet to get "cgi-like" and not "/cgi-like" will perform a GET and not run any commands

PS - Thank you very much for everything Professor Keen!
